<h1>{{ page.title }}</h1>
<p>I'm a sophomore at the University of Michigan studying Computer Science and Math. 
   I'm interested in software development, especially working on challenging backend problems, 
   and data science. 
   I also enjoy investing and like to write about it sometimes (see <a href="/blog">blog</a>).  
   Feel free to reach out to me if you have any questions or want to work together!
